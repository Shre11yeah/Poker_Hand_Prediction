🎴 Poker Hand Prediction using Machine Learning

In this project, a machine learning model was built to predict poker hand categories (such as One Pair, Two Pair, Straight, Flush, Full House, etc.) based on the card values and suits of 5 playing cards.
The dataset contains card combinations along with their final classified hand rank. After performing exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, and feature engineering, multiple models were trained — including Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression — to classify poker hands efficiently.

The entire project includes data visualization, model comparison, and evaluation using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
This project demonstrates feature encoding techniques and multi-class classification performance in card-based probability problems.
